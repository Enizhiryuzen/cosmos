# Store

The `store` package contains the implementation of store/v2, which is the SDK's
abstraction around managing historical and committed state. See [ADR-065](../docs/architecture/adr-065-store-v2.md)
and [Store v2 Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6uXIjTPHOOWM5N4sUUmUfCZvePoa5SNfIEtmgvgQSU/edit#heading=h.nz8dqy6wa4g1) for a high-level overview of the design and rationale.
